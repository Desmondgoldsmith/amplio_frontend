      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-center mb-6">The Problem</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-center max-w-3xl mx-auto">
        Development organizations recognize the benefit of SBC programming 
        but they often don't know where to start. There's a lot to consider when 
        integrating SBC approaches into program design, implementation, 
        management, and accountability. Even programs with a strong SBC 
        foundation can fail when there's a gap between design (e.g., theory of 
        change) and implementation (tracking each activity).
