      Our Basic Service Package includes Talking Book devices, software set up and training, and M&E support for one year.
    </h2>

    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      In addition to the cost of Talking Book devices, we charge a basic service fee. We want to ensure you have the skills and support to launch and run a successful program. After the first year, you will receive lifetime access to Amplio's suite of self-service products. This means that once you're up and running, you can use your Talking Books over and over again.

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">How many Talking Books?</h3>
      
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Our team can help you to determine how many Talking Books you will need for the audience you want to reach. Depending on the program design, a single device can serve up to 100 listeners or more!
